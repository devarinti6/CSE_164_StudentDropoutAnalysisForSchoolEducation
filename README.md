# CSE_164_StudentDropoutAnalysisForSchoolEducation

Student Dropout Analysis for School Education using Random Forest

This project predicts student dropout risk using Random Forest models by analyzing academic performance, attendance, socio-economic, and behavioral features. The system helps schools and institutions identify at-risk students early and take preventive actions.

🎯 Objectives
Identify key factors influencing student dropout
Predict dropout probability using machine learning
Provide visual insights through graphs and dashboards
Help institutions take timely interventions
